 * Caret-restoration support for refactorings that edit the document directly.

 * call the Refactoring SPI's `undoChange()`; afterwards the editor's own queued caret handling
 * (`EditorCaret`) snaps the caret to the end of the reverted document. To restore the caret to
 * where the user triggered the refactoring, a [CaretRestoreOnUndoEdit] is joined to the same atomic
 * undo group as the text edits, and its `undo()` repositions the caret.
